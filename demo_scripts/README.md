- demo_results
  This folder contains some nice results from the example scripts
  
- plotting
  This folder contains code that is reused by multiple scripts here, to plot the results.

- throughput_rssi_ssid_bssid_tcp.py
  Uses a wireless endpoint to map the possible TCP throughput on the RSSI reported by the device.
  Stores the collected information in a CSV file.
  Generates a small html file, containing a graph of the results over time.
  Have a look at the demo_results.
  
- throughput_rssi_ssid_bssid_tcp.py
  Does the same as throughput_rssi_ssid_bssid_tcp.py, but using UDP traffic instead of TCP.
  
- requirements.txt
  Used dependencies. Install these first, before using the demo scripts.

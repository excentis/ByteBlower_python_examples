# ByteBlower port examples

- ipv4.py

  Straightforward IPv4 frameblasting test.

- ipv4_outofsequence.py

  Demonstrates the use of latency measurements with ByteBlower ports.  The example is IPv4 only,
  but the IPv6 implementation is analoguous.  Please refer to the basic IPv6 examples for how to
  setup IPv6 streams and triggers.

- ipv4_outofsequence.py
  
  Demonstrates the use of out of sequence detections.  This example is IPv4 only, but IPv6
  is analogue.  Please refer to IPv6 examples for IPv6 setup of streams and triggers.

- ipv6.py

  Straightforward IPv6 frameblasting test.

- tcp.py

  Explains how to run statefull TCP between 2 ByteBlower ports.  IPv4 and IPv6 are covered.
